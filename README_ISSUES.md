# README: Issues Encountered During Development

This document outlines the issues faced during the recent development effort, primarily concerning the implementation and testing of new initial condition methodologies for the GPM-BVAR models.

## Successfully Completed Tasks:

1.  **Code Refactoring into `gpmcore` Package:**
    *   The codebase was successfully refactored into a Python package named `gpmcore`.
    *   This involved moving relevant modules (`gpm_parser.py`, `gpm_bvar_trends.py`, `Kalman_filter_jax.py`, `simulation_smoothing.py`, `stationary_prior_jax_simplified.py`, `reporting_plots.py`, `gpm_bar_smoother.py`) into the `gpmcore` directory.
    *   An `__init__.py` file was added to expose key functionalities.
    *   Import statements were updated, and basic package importability was verified.

2.  **Implementation of New Initial Condition Logic (Core):**
    *   The core logic for two new methods for handling initial conditions (`y_0`) in the Kalman filter was implemented within the `create_gpm_based_model_with_conditional_init` function in `gpmcore/gpm_bvar_trends.py`:
        *   **MCMC with Conditional Priors (`use_mcmc_conditional_init=True`):** Samples `y_0` from `N(mu_y0, Gamma_y0)`, where `mu_y0` and `Gamma_y0` are derived conditionally on other sampled VAR parameters (using `initial_values` from GPM files for trend means and `gamma_list` for stationary VAR component covariances).
        *   **Hierarchical Priors (`use_hierarchical_init=True`):** Samples `y_0` from `N(mu_y0_hierarchical, Gamma_y0_hierarchical)`, where `mu_y0_hierarchical` and `Gamma_y0_hierarchical` are themselves sampled from specified hyperpriors.

## Primary Issue: Failure of File Modification Tools

The main blocker encountered was the persistent failure of the available file modification tools (`replace_with_git_merge_diff` and `overwrite_file_with_block`) when attempting to modify `gpmcore/gpm_bvar_trends.py` in later stages.

*   **Targeted Modification:** The goal was to update the public API function `fit_gpm_model` within `gpmcore/gpm_bvar_trends.py`. This function needed its signature updated to accept the new boolean flags (`use_mcmc_conditional_init`, `use_hierarchical_init`, `use_conditional_init`) and to pass these flags internally to `create_gpm_based_model_with_conditional_init`.
*   **Tool Failures:**
    *   `replace_with_git_merge_diff` often failed with complex changes.
    *   `overwrite_file_with_block` (used as a fallback by providing the entire intended file content) started failing with a generic "Edit failed" message, without specific details, especially when the content for `gpmcore/gpm_bvar_trends.py` became larger with the test harness logic.

## Consequences of Tool Failures:

1.  **`fit_gpm_model` Not Updated:** The `fit_gpm_model` function in `gpmcore/gpm_bvar_trends.py` likely **does not** correctly accept the new initialization flags or pass them to the underlying `create_gpm_based_model_with_conditional_init` function. It may still be calling the older `create_gpm_based_model` or calling the correct function but without the new flag parameters.
    *   **Location to Check/Fix:** The definition of `fit_gpm_model` in `gpmcore/gpm_bvar_trends.py`.
    *   **Expected Change:**
        ```python
        def fit_gpm_model(
            gpm_file_path: str, 
            y: jnp.ndarray, 
            num_warmup: int = 1000, 
            num_samples: int = 2000, 
            num_chains: int = 4, 
            rng_key: jnp.ndarray = random.PRNGKey(0),
            use_conditional_init: bool = False,      # <-- Add this
            use_mcmc_conditional_init: bool = False, # <-- Add this
            use_hierarchical_init: bool = False,     # <-- Add this
            conditioning_strength: float = 0.1       # <-- Ensure this is present if needed by the conditional init function
        ):
            print(f"Parsing GPM file: {gpm_file_path}")
            # Ensure this calls create_gpm_based_model_with_conditional_init with all flags
            model_fn, gpm_model, ss_builder = create_gpm_based_model_with_conditional_init(
                gpm_file_path,
                use_conditional_init=use_conditional_init,
                use_mcmc_conditional_init=use_mcmc_conditional_init,
                use_hierarchical_init=use_hierarchical_init,
                conditioning_strength=conditioning_strength
            )
            # ... rest of the function
        ```

2.  **Testing Incomplete:**
    *   A test script `run_init_tests.py` was successfully created in the root directory. This script is designed to call `fit_gpm_model` with each of the new initialization flags.
    *   However, because `fit_gpm_model` itself is likely not updated, running `run_init_tests.py` will probably result in `TypeError` (due to unexpected keyword arguments) or will not correctly test the new initialization logic.
    *   The planned modification of `example_gpm_workflow` in `gpmcore/gpm_bvar_trends.py` to serve as a test harness also could not be saved.

## Suggestions for Next Steps:

1.  **Manually Verify/Correct `fit_gpm_model`:**
    *   Open `gpmcore/gpm_bvar_trends.py`.
    *   Inspect the `fit_gpm_model` function.
    *   Ensure its signature includes `use_conditional_init`, `use_mcmc_conditional_init`, and `use_hierarchical_init`.
    *   Ensure it calls `create_gpm_based_model_with_conditional_init` and passes these flags correctly.

2.  **Run `run_init_tests.py`:**
    *   After confirming `fit_gpm_model` is correct, execute `python run_init_tests.py` from the root directory.
    *   This script will attempt to fit the model using each initialization strategy with minimal MCMC settings. Observe the output for errors or successful completion messages.

3.  **Further Debugging:**
    *   Based on the output of `run_init_tests.py`, debug any issues within the respective initialization logic in `create_gpm_based_model_with_conditional_init`.

Thank you for your help in resolving these issues!
